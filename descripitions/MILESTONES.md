# Project Milestones: Anki Export Comparison Tool

## 1. Data Analysis and Requirements Gathering (Week 1)
- Analyze the structure of Anki export files from both web and Android versions
- Identify key fields and data formats that need comparison
- Document the expected differences that might occur (missing cards, field differences, etc.)
- Determine the desired output format for difference reporting

## 2. Basic Project Setup (Week 1)
- Create project structure and repository
- Set up development environment
- Implement basic file loading and parsing capabilities
- Write initial tests for file parsing

## 3. Core Comparison Logic (Week 2)
- Develop algorithms to identify different types of discrepancies:
  - Missing cards in either export
  - Content differences in shared cards
  - Metadata differences (tags, deck assignments, etc.)
- Implement efficient data structures for comparison
- Create unit tests for comparison logic

## 4. User Interface Development (Week 2-3)
- Design a simple, intuitive interface (command-line initially)
- Implement file selection/input mechanism
- Create formatted output of differences
- Add configuration options for comparison sensitivity

## 5. Advanced Features (Week 3)
- Implement filtering capabilities for difference types
- Add statistical summary of differences
- Create export functionality for difference reports
- Support for partial exports comparison

## 6. Testing and Refinement (Week 4)
- Comprehensive testing with various export files
- Performance optimization for large exports
- Edge case handling
- User feedback implementation

## 7. Documentation and Delivery (Week 4)
- Create user documentation
- Write technical documentation for future maintenance
- Package the application for easy distribution
- Final quality assurance

## Success Criteria
- Program correctly identifies all differences between export files
- Performance is acceptable with large exports (>10,000 cards)
- Output is clear and actionable for users
- Tool is easy to use with minimal setup requirements
