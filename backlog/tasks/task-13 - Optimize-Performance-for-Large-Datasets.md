## Description
Optimize the similarity matching performance for large datasets (1000+ cards), including algorithm improvements, caching, and memory management.

## Requirements
- Optimize similarity calculation algorithms
- Implement caching for repeated calculations
- Improve memory management for large datasets
- Add progress indicators for long operations
- Benchmark performance improvements

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Profile current performance with large datasets
- [ ] Optimize similarity calculation algorithms
- [ ] Implement caching for similarity scores
- [ ] Improve memory management and garbage collection
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long operations
- [ ] Implement parallel processing where possible
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and monitoring
- [ ] Test with datasets of various sizes (100, 1000, 10000 cards)

## Dependencies
- task-12 (Similarity results in export generation)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/anki_differ/core/similarity.py` (performance optimizations)
- `src/anki_differ/core/matching.py` (algorithm optimizations)
- `src/anki_differ/web/app.py` (progress indicators)
- `tests/performance/test_large_dataset_performance.py` (new test file)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Significant performance improvement for large datasets
- Caching reduces redundant calculations
- Memory usage optimized for large datasets
- Progress indicators provide user feedback
- Performance benchmarks show improvements
- System remains responsive during long operations
- Performance tests pass with large datasets
