## Description
Comprehensive testing of similarity matching functionality with various card types, content formats, and edge cases to ensure robust operation.

## Requirements
- Test with different card content types (text, HTML, images, etc.)
- Test with various languages and character sets
- Test edge cases (empty cards, very long cards, special characters)
- Validate similarity scoring accuracy
- Performance testing with large datasets

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Create test datasets with various card types
- [ ] Test text-only cards with different languages
- [ ] Test HTML-formatted cards
- [ ] Test cards with special characters and Unicode
- [ ] Test empty and minimal content cards
- [ ] Test very long cards (performance)
- [ ] Validate similarity scoring accuracy
- [ ] Test with large datasets (1000+ cards)
- [ ] Create automated test suite

## Dependencies
- task-8 (User actions for similar card pairs)

## Files to Create/Modify
- `tests/unit/test_similarity_edge_cases.py` (new test file)
- `tests/performance/test_similarity_performance.py` (new test file)
- `tests/fixtures/similarity_test_data.py` (new test data)
- `tests/e2e/test_similarity_workflow.py` (new E2E test)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All card types handled correctly
- Different languages and character sets work
- Edge cases handled gracefully
- Similarity scoring is accurate
- Performance acceptable for large datasets
- Comprehensive test suite passes
- No regressions in existing functionality
