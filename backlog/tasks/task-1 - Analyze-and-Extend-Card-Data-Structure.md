## Description
Analyze the current Card data structure and extend it to support additional metadata required for similarity matching functionality.

## Requirements
- Review existing Card class/structure in core modules
- Identify what additional metadata fields are needed for similarity matching
- Design extension without breaking existing functionality
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Sub-tasks
- [x] Analyze current Card implementation in `src/anki_differ/core/`
- [x] Identify required metadata fields (similarity_score, match_status, etc.)
- [x] Design Card structure extension
- [x] Update Card class/structure with new fields
- [x] Verify no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Implementation Summary
- Created new `Card` class in `src/anki_differ/core/card.py` with similarity metadata support
- Added `SimilarityMetadata` class with fields: similarity_score, match_id, status, algorithm_data
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing tuple-based functions
- Updated core modules (diff.py, merge.py, selective.py, web/app.py) to use new Card class
- Added comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- All 21 unit tests pass, confirming no breaking changes

## Dependencies
- None (foundation task)

## Files to Modify
- `src/anki_differ/core/diff.py` (likely location of Card structure)
- Related core modules that use Card data

## Acceptance Criteria
- Card structure supports similarity metadata
- Existing functionality remains intact
- New fields have appropriate defaults
- Documentation updated for new fields
