## Description
Analyze the current Card data structure and extend it to support additional metadata required for similarity matching functionality.

## Requirements
- Review existing Card class/structure in core modules
- Identify what additional metadata fields are needed for similarity matching
- Design extension without breaking existing functionality
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Analyze current Card implementation in `src/anki_differ/core/`
- [ ] Identify required metadata fields (similarity_score, match_status, etc.)
- [ ] Design Card structure extension
- [ ] Update Card class/structure with new fields
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes to existing functionality

## Dependencies
- None (foundation task)

## Files to Modify
- `src/anki_differ/core/diff.py` (likely location of Card structure)
- Related core modules that use Card data

## Acceptance Criteria
- Card structure supports similarity metadata
- Existing functionality remains intact
- New fields have appropriate defaults
- Documentation updated for new fields
